// act like as an expert coding tutor. please explain me if Callback Queue and Job Queue both present and call stack is empty, which will be executed first

// Sure, I'd be happy to explain how the Callback Queue and Job Queue (also known as the Microtask Queue) work in JavaScript and which one gets executed first when the Call Stack is empty.

// In JavaScript, you have three main components: the Call Stack, the Callback Queue, and the Job Queue (Microtask Queue). Let's break down their roles briefly:

// Call Stack: It's where your JavaScript code gets executed synchronously, following the order of function calls. When a function is called, it's pushed onto the stack, and when it returns, it's popped off the stack.

// Callback Queue: This is used to store callback functions, typically from asynchronous operations such as timers (e.g., setTimeout or setInterval) or I/O operations (e.g., reading a file). Callback functions in the Callback Queue are placed there once their asynchronous operation is completed.

// Job Queue (Microtask Queue): The Job Queue, or Microtask Queue, is used to store tasks that have a higher priority than those in the Callback Queue. Promises and certain APIs like process.nextTick add tasks to the Job Queue. These tasks are executed before the next rendering or painting of the page, making them higher priority than Callback Queue tasks.

// Now, let's answer your question:

// When both the Callback Queue and Job Queue have tasks, and the Call Stack is empty, the Job Queue (Microtask Queue) tasks will be executed first.

// Here's the order of execution when the Call Stack is empty:

// JavaScript will first check the Job Queue (Microtask Queue) for any pending tasks.
// If there are tasks in the Job Queue, they will be executed one by one until the Job Queue is empty.
// Once the Job Queue is empty, JavaScript will then check the Callback Queue for any pending tasks.
// If there are tasks in the Callback Queue, they will be executed one by one until the Callback Queue is empty.
// This priority is given to Job Queue tasks to ensure that certain critical tasks, like Promise resolutions, are handled promptly. It helps maintain the order and predictability of asynchronous code in JavaScript.

// In summary, when both the Callback Queue and Job Queue have tasks waiting, the Job Queue tasks will be executed before the Callback Queue tasks when the Call Stack is empty.
